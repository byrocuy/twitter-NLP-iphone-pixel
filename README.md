Seeing the enthusiasm of netizens and tech-reviewers for the launch of the Iphone 14 and Pixel 7, I tried to explores how's the impression of the two products from Twitter user. Sentiment analysis was carried out on Twitter users' tweets based on the tweet text containing the keywords 'Iphone 14' and 'Pixel 7'. The sentiment analysis method used in this project are VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) and RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) to see whether netizens' impressions are negative, neutral, or positive about the product launch. The results of the analysis are plotted in bar graph to see a comparison of the impressions of the two products.
